# Dense reward configuration for Lift task
reward_mode: "dense"

# Reward type: "parallel" (all components at once) or "staged" (curriculum)
reward_type: "parallel"

# Reward weights (use negative for penalty)
weights:
  approach: 2.0        # Approach cube (gripper reference point → cube center)
  horizontal_displacement: -50.0  # Penalize cube XY displacement from initial position
  lift: 50.0           # Lift cube up (height in meters, scaled up)
  success: 10.0        # Task completion bonus
  fail: -100.0         # Penalty when cube goes out of bounds

# Approach reward curve (piecewise linear)
# reward = 1.0 if distance < threshold
# reward = linear decay from 1.0 to 0.0 between threshold and zero_point
approach_threshold: 0.01     # Distance for full reward (1cm)
approach_zero_point: 0.20    # Distance where reward becomes 0 (20cm)

# Gripper reference point offsets (in meters)
# The reference point is where the cube center should be when properly grasped
gripper_tip_offset: 0.015    # Along jaw: back from tip (1.5cm)
gripper_outward_offset: 0.015  # Perpendicular: outward for cube (1.5cm)

# Lift reward height range (meters)
# lift_reward = clamp(height, 0, lift_max_height) * weight
lift_max_height: 0.10        # Cap lift reward at 10cm (no reward increase above this)

# Success condition: cube must stay >= lift_target for stable_hold_time seconds
lift_target: 0.05           # Height threshold (5cm)
stable_hold_time: 10.0      # Required hold time in seconds (at 30Hz = 300 steps)

# Fail condition: cube XY must stay within this rectangle (meters)
# If cube goes outside, episode terminates with fail penalty
# Set to null or remove to disable bounds checking

# Stage thresholds (for staged reward)
stages:
