# Dense reward configuration for Lift task
reward_mode: "dense"

# Reward type: "parallel" (all components at once) or "staged" (curriculum)
reward_type: "staged"

# Reward weights
weights:
  reach: 1.0         # Approach cube
  grasp: 2.0         # Successfully grasp
  lift: 100.0        # Lift cube up (height in meters, so needs high weight)
  success: 10.0      # Task completion bonus

# Scaling
reach_scale: 5.0     # tanh(distance * scale) for reach reward

# Stage thresholds (for staged reward)
stages:
  reach_threshold: 0.05    # Distance to unlock grasp stage (5cm)
  grasp_threshold: 0.03    # Distance to consider grasped (3cm)
  lift_target: 0.05        # Height for success (5cm)
